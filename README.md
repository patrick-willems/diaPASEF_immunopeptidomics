# Bacterial diaPASEF immunopeptidomics
This repository includes raw search results and jupyter notebooks used to parse, filter and plot host and bacterial immunopeptides. Resulting SVG vector files were in the (supplemental) figures of the manuscript. Input files are provided in the same directory as the jupyter notebook, while output files were in the output subdirectory.

Additional python packages will have to be installed, e.g. bioPython, UpSet, pandas, numpy and so on.
